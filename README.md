# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Each file represents a different concept. Below is a brief description of each file:

## InfixToPrefix.py

This file contains a Python program that converts an infix expression to a prefix expression. It uses a stack to store operators and a queue to store the output.

## InfixToPostfix.py

This file contains a Python program that converts an infix expression to a postfix expression. It uses a stack to store operators and a queue to store the output.

## queue.py

This file contains a Python implementation of a queue data structure. It includes methods for checking if the queue is empty or full, adding elements to the queue (enqueue), and removing elements from the queue (dequeue).

## priorityQueue.py

This file contains a Python implementation of a priority queue data structure. It includes methods for checking if the queue is empty, adding elements to the queue with a priority, and removing the element with the highest priority.

## stack.py

This file contains a Python implementation of a stack data structure. It includes methods for checking if the stack is empty or full, adding elements to the stack (push), removing elements from the stack (pop), and finding the maximum and minimum elements in the stack.
